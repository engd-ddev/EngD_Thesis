# Pygwy Scripts

This folder contains the Pygwy scripts for Gwyddion that were used for processing the AFM images for statistical roughness quantification. There is a file for Method 1 and Method 2 roughness quantification.

The script outputs the data in a .txt file, as well as outputting post-processed AFM images as .gwy files and .jpg files for easy viewing. 
Method 2 also outputs .txt files for the individual line profiles and a metadata file on which lines were extracted.
