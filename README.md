# EngD_Thesis
This repository contains code that is shared with the EngD thesis written by Dhilan Devadasan in Sept 2022.

The code shared here includes functions that were used for the statistical processes used on the SiC roughness assessment as well as the code used in the AWS computer vision applications to detect anomalous images. 

Some Pygwy files are also included to aid in the processing of the microscopy images.
